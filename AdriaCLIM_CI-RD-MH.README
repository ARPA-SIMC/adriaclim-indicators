AdriaCLIM Climate Indicators

Computation of Water Resources (RD) related Climate Indicators based on
- European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) for 1991-2020, and
- AdriaCLIM Climate Downscale Simulations using WRF for 1991-2020 and 2021-2050,
foreseen in the AdriaCLIM project:
[ RD-1 ] River Discharge
[ RD-2 ] Mean River Flow
[ RD-3 ] Minimum River Flow
[ RD-4 ] Maximum River Discharge
[ RD-5 ] Standardized Flow Index (SFI)

and computation of Meteo-Hydrological (MH) related Climate Indicators based on
- the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather (ERA5) for 1991-2020, and
- AdriaCLIM Climate Downscale Simulations using WRF-Hydro for 1991-2020 and 2021-2050,
foreseen in the AdriaCLIM project:
[MH-1] Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)
[MH-2] Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)
[MH-3] Number of Consecutive Days without Precipitation

NEEDS:
> 6-Hourly EFAS data in NetCDF placed in "EFAS" directory (one file by month);
> Hourly WRFHydro data placed in "WRFHydro" directory (single file in csv);
> Hourly ERA5 data in NetCDF placed at "ERA5" directory (one file by month)
  containing Total precipitation (tp) and Temperature at 2m (t2m);
> 6-Hourly WRF data in NetCDF placed in "WRF" directory (one file by month)
  containing Total precipitation (precip_tot) and Temperature at 2m (T_2m);

All these modelling data needed to compute the Climate Indicators RD and MH are available on CMCC ERDDAP Platform dedicated to AdriaCLIM project:
http://erddap-adriaclim.cmcc-opa.eu/erddap/info/


The codes are in Wolfram's Mathematica computational language.
To run them using a free license, a free account login is needed.
Please, follow these simple 3 steps to prepare your environment:

1) Install the WolframScript library as https://reference.wolfram.com/language/workflow/InstallWolframScript.html

2) Sign in at https://account.wolfram.com/login/create

3) From a terminal, provide your credentials using
$ wolframscript -username example-user@wolfram.com -password XXXXXX
This step must be done only the first time or if you change the computer.


With the code file and the input file folders in the same directory, call the following command from a terminal to compute the AdriaCLIM Climate Indicators:

a) For [RD] Water Resources Climate Indicators
   using AdriaCLIM WRFHydro data (1991-2050)
$  wolframscript -file AdriaCLIM_CI-RD_WRFHydro.wls


b) For [RD] Water Resources Climate Indicators
   using the reference dataset EFAS (1991-2020)
$  wolframscript -file AdriaCLIM_CI-RD_EFAS.wls


c) For [MH] Hydro-Meteorological Climate Indicators
   using AdriaCLIM WRF data (1991-2050)
$  wolframscript -file AdriaCLIM_CI-MH_WRF.wls


d) For [MH] Hydro-Meteorological Climate Indicators
   using the reference dataset EFAS (1991-2020)
$  wolframscript -file AdriaCLIM_CI-MH_ERA5.wls


For a specific time interval running, add the initial and final year as arguments at the command line:
Ex.
$  wolframscript -file AdriaCLIM_CI-RD_EFAS.wls 1992 2011
Remember, the analysis periods foreseen in AdriaCLIM are 1991-2020 (historical) and 2021-2050 (projection). Thus, only time intervals within the same analysis period are allowed.
